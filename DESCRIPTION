Description: A Memory-Efficient, Visualize-Enhanced, Parallel-Accelerated Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Tool. it can
    (1) effectively process large data, 
    (2) rapidly evaluate population structure, 
    (3) efficiently estimate variance components several algorithms, 
    (4) implement parallel-accelerated association tests of markers three methods, 
    (5) globally efficient design on GWAS process computing, 
    (6) enhance visualization of related information.
