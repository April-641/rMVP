Description: rMVP can: (1) effectively process large GWAS data, (2) rapidly evaluate population structure, (3) efficiently estimate variance components by EMMAX, FaST-LMM, and HE regression algorithms, (4) implement parallel-accelerated association tests of markers using GLM, MLM, and FarmCPU methods; methods; (5) globally efficient design on GWAS process computing; and (6) enhance visualization of GWAS related information.
